positive,"['loving urban spaces', 'finding alleyways', 'seeing lit-up windows', 'many details and slices of life', 'full enjoyment', 'highest praise']",[],null,this was probably my first preorder i felt that if the game turned out to be the worst game i played or didnt even run 10 dollars i paid for the witcher 2 and the witcher 3 felt so much like stealing that the extra 60 would still not cover the amount i would pay for the enjoyment i got from themafter putting 160 hours on cyberpunk 2077 i can say that it fully deserves the full price i paid for it on its own merits and after so many disappointments in the recent aaa releases that i had this is the highest praise that i can give to this game ill start by saying that i love urban spaces i love finding alleyways that i have never seen before in my real life neighbourhood i love seeing all those lit up windows at night and i love that there are so many details and slices of life in every corner in city city to is the greatest work the humanity can achieve due to its intricacy its organic nature and how it reflects the human condition since the liberty city of gta iv most games have been disappointment in this regard for example skyrims cities consisted of 20 npcs and copy pasted guards santos of gta v was just sanitary and small theme park that just could not function as city if it was translated into real life and san francisco of watch_dogs 2 was utterly devoid of character and charm previous game of cd projekt red the witcher 3 came close to what i expect from digital urban space novigrad and to some extent toussaint were brimming with life and had all the details that real urban space might have but failed in sizethe real protagonist of the marketing campaign for this game was the city itself especially in night city wire episodes v and his or her story was in the background and rightly so because this game even with its minor issues been the greatest city that ever been built in game every district even every alleyway so many details that i was amazed that my gtx 1070 could even run it at stable fps rate too by the way there is never seen before verticality in night city when gta iv came out i was impressed how many buildings there were that you could enter but most of them were just copy paste jobs with real character to them in 12 years that passed since its release i had expected that this would be polished and taken further but this did not happen until now night city on the other hand does not only offer tons of welldesigned buildings that you can enter but completely opens up new appreciation for the city once you get the leg cyberware that allows you to double or power jump you probably should get one of those early you can probably spend hours parkouring around buildings while focusing on every little detail that been lovingly crafted and placed even some streets have multiple levels and while this is common occurrence in real cities i never noticed their absence in digital urban spaces until i visited night city not only verticality distinguishes night city from others at 160 hours i know that there are probably hundreds of alleyways and tens of shopsbarsbuildings that i never visited and even though i have completed the game at this point i look forward to going back to the game and dissect every little detail in those and the small stories they tell especially whoever designed the graffiti around the city deserves raise as i often found myself looking at those admiringly wishing that the city i live in had some of thosegameplay wise i was not expecting much just witcher in 2077 and this would have satisfied but the game we got is beautiful lovechild of the witcher and deus ex every minor quest offers multiple paths you can take if you have the necessary skill level on body or technical ability and i had fun exploring every one of them that i could have found but i can not deny that this level of freedom sometimes makes the game too easy and if you can not go through some path you can always find alternatives that allows you to skip most of the level and reach the objective quicklygames difficulty level i played on hard is not helped by the fact that there are so many perks you can obtain to transform yourself into demigod that one shots the opponent most of the time i was doing 400k damage with my sniper rifle at the end of the game but enemies can often one shot you as well if you are playing on hard or very hard if you are an experienced player i absolutely recommend picking one of those two difficulty levels there is good amount of weapon variety and unique reload and equip animations and they make you feel like the most badass merc in the city you can also use different hacks to keep your hands relatively clean but i wont spoil this part as i loved seeing how those most of those hacks worked for the first timestory and the characters are amazing i did not think that i would enjoy this game as much as i did enjoy the witcher games as i am annoyed by the rampant individualism of the modern world and most of the themes of the cyberpunk genre hit too close to home but they found good balance between the dissolving sense of community and aforementioned rampant individualism i did not expect that the so many of the character side quests would dabble on the same issue that been driving mad and this theme was executed perfectly without stepping on too many tropes of the modern storywriting for these side quests i feel that the only thing is missing is proper closure or change that impact the world but it is also possible to consider this as deliberate choice as v is just passing merc and not the main character one of the most groundbreaking parts of cyberpunk 2077 is that usually you feel like companion in other peoples main quests and this is extremely refreshing to see game where the world does not revolve around player character i feel like this should have been fleshed out more with stalker like system where every gangcommunity its explicit objectives and the player can see and impact this dynamic struggle for power or survival but maybe this is expecting too much from game that already achieves so muchthe main story is more related to traditional cyberpunk genre themes especially transhumanism libertarian erosion of the state or in better terms absolute corporate dictatorship and artificial intelligence but how they are presented elevates cyberpunk 2077 from another example of the genre to unique experience compared to newer deus ex games where these themes are so on the nose that these issues become mundane everyday thing cyberpunk 2077 with the inclusion of johnny silverhand approaches these themes with so much clarity and simplicity that you never feel the necessity to take breather to adjust your suspension of disbelief you may feel like the main story should have been longer and i thought of the same from time to time but at least there is cohesive story that will force an expulsion of feelings catharsis at numerous points of the story first person point of view and plethora of facial expressions that the characters employ greatly contributes to this as v been much more of relatable character than the most due to povanother innovation that i believe will pass under the radar is how i never felt the obligation to be mr goody two shoes during the game and could usually transfer my personal beliefs and judgement into the story without being punished by it which is so rare in most games you will often be punished by locking you out of content or forcing you to get worse ending if you are not some form of stoic angel but cyberpunk 2077 does not have this problemplease see comments for the rest of my review as i have exhausted the space given to by steam sounds bugs and final conclusion are in the comments
negative,[],"['dissapointing', 'biased', 'painful', 'huge fantasy and rpg fan', 'witcher franchise', 'favorite gaming franchises', 'entertaining quality content rich titles', 'favorite developer studio', 'topped it']",difficult,oh well admittedly its difficult for to write this review let start by saying that i was and kind of still am pretty biased regarding cdpr and their games and thats why its painful to admit and accept the fact that in its current state cp 2077 is very dissapointing by cdpr standards and in general as wellim huge fantasy and rpg fan and with the witcher trilogy cdpr created one of my favorite gaming franchises i loved all 3 witcher games thronebreaker played gwent on gog for dozens of hours and all of them are entertaining quality content rich titles so my personal experiences with their previous products the countless hours i invested in them and the enjoyment i got out of them pretty much made cdpr my favorite developer studio and they even topped it with their attitude towards their community and the continous support they provide to their games patches and fixes years after release free dlcs paid expansions with incredible amount of contentas lot of other gamers i highly anticipated cp 2077 i had pretty solid idea what to expect i was familiar with previous cdpr titles and i knew it will be heavily text and dialogue based rpg and did not expect fastpaced futuristic fps gta or whatever so im not one of those who compare it to gta v screen by screen neither i complain about the amount of dialogues or the slowburning storyfurthermore i consciously didnt sit on the hypetrain like lot of dumbasses i didnt expect this game to be some kind of miracle that would bring groundbreaking neverbeforeseen innovations in its every aspect and would revolutionize the gaming industry forever i remembered the buggy state in which the witcher 3 was released so i expected to encounter bugs as well my point is that i had pretty high but not unrealistic hopes and expectations for cyberpunk 2077i knew it wouldnt be able to live to the unbelievable hype that was generated around it but cdpr can only be partly blamed for that the unrealistic hype was mostly generated by gaming portals and journalists i do not wish to go into detail about the state of todays gaming journalism and the quality it represents because its ridiculous and pathetic beyond measure and the highly toxic gaming community itself id love to address this as well and share my opinion but i could rant on and on about this for hours but lets just say that its just sad that in 2020 its common that developers receive deaththreaths over the delay of videogame by some basementdweller pathetic nerd get life dudeso lets talk about the gameso far i have played for around 60 hours and i still havent finished the story but i usually take my time in rpgs and complete every sidequest explore everything that i can etc so thats normal i guess its true that you can rush through the story under 1520 hours but who in their right minds would do that in any rpg initially i didnt encounter that many bugs only few barely noticable graphical glitches but nothing gamebreaking the game only crashed once over the span of 60 hours and i had pretty stable performance and smooth experience with my rtx 2080 but bugs became more frequent and severe as i played more besides the mentioned graphical glitches ive seen wierd animations missing textures cars disappearing and popping out of nowhere cars falling from the sky quests that can not be finished unlootable items and so onthe hotfixes didnt bring that much improvement at least regarding those bugs that i experienced but based on the state the witcher 3 was released and the one it is in now im sure all of these will be resolved with the upcoming patches in the next monthsthe graphics are pretty solid with max settings the city looks great the characters sometimes are less so but its appealing to look at its nothing jawdropping and thats totally fine by its very sad when someone thinks that good graphics good game i definitely love the atmosphere of the game the hightech lowlife futuristic cyberpunk setting is great you can feel the strong bladerunner influence and the great music and soundtrack complements the atmosphere very wellmoving on to the story as i said i havent finished it yet so i cant form an opinion about it in its entirety buts its kind of letdown so far its not the worst i wouldnt even say its bad sadly its just not that interesting to make want to get to the end of it and it doesnt help that that the first 1015 main quests and the story they cover have been spoiled by the trailers before release some of the sidequests are more interesting than the main story but the other gigs and jobs become just dull and repetitive quicklymy main problem is that cyberpunk 2077 lacks lot of mechanics that in my opinion would be must in such worldsetting character customization is not that bad as some say there are plenty of options but i have to agree that i have seen far more detailed customization possibilites in other games ok you can choose the color of your teeth the size and shape of your but whats the purpose you cant even see your character outside of the inventory screen not even during sex sequencesin world where body modification is not just possible but pretty much common thing with cyberware implants etc and where looks in general are above all else the fact that you cant alter your appearance later on during the game is just pathetic you cant even get haircut which is pretty much inexcusable nowadays especially that even the witcher 3 offered such possibilitessince cyberpunk 2077 is an rpg your clothes and equipment obv provide stat boosts if you want to use items that provide better stats you constantly have to change them and because of that most of the time your appearance is ridiculous and you look like homeless who dresses from lost and found bin why isnt there an option to change the looks of your clothes while keeping the new stats lot of other games utilize such functionality transmogrification and even tough this is not fantasy rpg changing the appearance of clothes can be easily explained in scifi setting as well for example with some kind of holographic technology or whateveranother big problem is that sadly there is not much to do in night city there are plenty of sidequests which are fine you have tons of gigs and other sidejobs but these jobs are almost identical apprehend or kill cyberpsycho kill some gang members here and there retrieve some intel from somewhere etc and they become repetitive very quickly and besides this there is nothing there are few collectibles you can buy cars and motorcycles there few races and underground fighting pits or something like that and with that we are at the end of the listonce again id like to mention that i know this is not sandbox action game its an openworld rpg i dont want to play pool or bowling or things like that like some peep mentioned comparing it to gta v but in 2020 i expected more it was emphasized that sex and sexual themes are very important well besides some romance options during sidequests there is 1 female and 1 male prostitue in night city on the same street you can bang them and thats it you cant even go to strip clubs or anything like thatjust to mention the driving i dont think its as bad as some say i didnt really have any problems with the controls or mechanics besides that the first person view is useless d but then again im not really into driving games and driving mechanics are just do not matter to in generali expected solid rpg but at the moment cp2077 feels unfinished rushed buggy and just very average which is nowhere near the usual cdpr quality and sadly i cant recommend it you should wait at least 1 year or half and check back then

negative,[],"['punitive', 'least satisfying', 'especially punishing', 'too much', 'delayed attacks', 'enhanced tracking', 'better ai']",difficult,i know many will handwave away any criticisms of this game as salt or reply with git gud but as fan of fromsoft games since demons souls this game felt like the most punitive and least satisfying of the games while the setting is undoubtedly beautiful and there is fascinating story and interesting characters the design philosophy of this game is especially punishing to put it mildly this game feels as if the character the moveset of dark souls 3 with the additions of counter guards and jumping attacks while the enemies have the moveset of bloodborne foes and the tracking of sekiro enemies foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks enhanced tracking and better ai while this works it feels like bit too much in some instances it feels like almost every enemy some 2880degree combo spin move giant area of effect explosion or some mix of both in addition to these challenging attacks to deal with enemy attacks are harder to read than ever with many different combos having the same startup or coming out incredibly fast while this may be product of the performance issues of the pc port some enemies feel as if they are fighting with lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally i have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where i will seemingly be dead angled by attacks hitting headon these factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do it is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900 damage in an attack which is death sentence for numerous characters especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes while numerous rune farming areas have been discovered it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes meanwhile literal giants that can on occasion pose threat drop similar rates of runes it feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas speaking of being unrewarding while this is probably personal problem i do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game i remember the hype of beating ornstein and smough gehrman pontiff sulyvahn and isshin the sword saint when i power through and defeat challenging boss in elden ring i feel annoyed despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat boss in elden ring i do not feel the same excitement i did in previous games i do not feel like i have accomplished something it just feels frustrating i am not entirely sure what causes this but the game does not feel rewarding still i will continue to play and i will beat it perhaps once that is done i will update my review and give final score however this been the least enjoyable of the fromsoft games i have played for now if you personally enjoy it that is great and more power to you but i have found the game unrewarding annoying and far more draining than any previous games rather than being left with sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game i remain left with feeling of annoyance as if i have completed tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle update it is shame i am not playing salt and sanctuary for this review been lucrative salt mineupdate 2 it appears this review gotten quite few responses welcome as mentioned before i will finish this game sunk cost fallacy or not i paid for it and i am far too deep to refund it now as of the writing of this update i am currently level 90 pure strength build i abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like i had hit wall with twohanded quality build at the moment this character hit bit of wall with commander niall if this information helps with your headcannon about you are welcomeupdate 3final thoughts now that i have become elden lord i still stand by most of what i have said while there are moments of the game i genuinely enjoy bosses such as the fire giant and the godskin duo are pretty emblematic of this games boss design and philosophy tedious frustrating and more of chore than something that can give actual hype while there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early openworld design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off i think many of the bosses feel less like test of skill and more like war of attrition war that you can lose highly quickly however it is war i ultimately won feat that at the time of this being typed 8 of players on steam have achieved i abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in little over 34 hours after some experimenting there are good elements of this game the world is beautiful the fashion souls are as great as ever and the customization been taken to the next level at the same time though the boss design is in my opinion some of the worst it ever been simultaneously there are many reused bosses and enemies even for fromsoft andor openworld game this always been the case in fromsoft games but this goes beyond even the dark souls 2 pursuer level of reuse there is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement however it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time you dont need to git gud to beat many of these bosses if you ask if you check in on any guide the answer seems to be most of the time you simply need to git bleed or perhaps git spellsupdate 4 seamless coop mod since i first played this game until now elden ring had several significant patches and quite few changes real ones will know the pain of 10 radahn however with the advent of mods especially the seamless coop mod the game is substantially more fun the coop been saving grace of many souls games not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur while i still think that on its own this is probably the weakest entry in froms current lineup the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better and furthermore the seamless coop mod allowed something genuinely magical to come about the game is substantially more fun and lot more wondrous in my opinion having constant companion to play it with faqqa did you try to adapt to elden ring mechanicsyes i used consumables the mimic tear ashes which is borderline mandatory in some bosses jumping attacks torrent followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got bleed weapon and i even dipped into faith to take helpful incantation these items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25000 hp max hp damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable will you continue to play the gamei might i am thinking about maybe playing character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries i also desire to help struggling players against bosses i have beaten and be friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating to be honest this is the only real grinding that i enjoy maidens i rushed through the game from story standpoint not an exploration standpoint so i did sacrifice her to become elden lord
positive,"['enlarged expectations', 'experienced enjoyable gameplay', 'characteristic features', 'consistent quality']",[],null,i had enormous expectations having put thousand hours into dark souls 3 alone sadly er is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through and refusal to question the ideals of framework first established with demons souls in 2009 and i ended it wishing i hadnt played it at all more on this later or that steam would finally add neutral ratingfor context excluding discarded run and multiplayer my completionist and almost entirely guidefree solo run lasted around 150 hours beating every boss barring malenia without summonslets open positively elden ring inherits ds3s dna particularly combat the same crunchy brawls responsive controls and toptier

impressive it fuses aesthetically and mechanically diverse biomes into vertiginously stacked layers threading interesting discoveries through challenging navigation aided by time of day and weather system that adds subtle gameplay changesso why the thumbs downds3 is great because its meaningful its an incredible fantasy brawler but shines with its premise of cursed world having its blighted existence artificially prolonged by an age of fire unnaturally lengthened by gwyn and his tragic legacys followers the ringed city dlc literally warped and smashed the series together until only ash remained at the end of the world and time itself in manifestation of cosmic decay from realm prohibited from moving on its creatively defiant metacommentary rejected pop culture engorged on commercialised nostalgia and humanitys obsession with the past impeding new better world being built using froms own ludography to show stagnation blocking progress it had to innovate to avoid hypocrisy so it repurposed old combat mechanics and weaponry into new rhythms and tonally shifted from quiet hope in the face of graceful sadness to crushing desperation not to fix its cursed world but to euthanise it and start anew instead while retaining the series unrelenting melancholy and heart of golder ignores that it retroactively invalidates ds3s message of moving on from an unsustainably tired world by repurposing years of content and when it does deviate it does so uncharacteristically clumsily for from this is why i wish i hadnt played it ds3 made laugh cry and stuck in my mind for years and was ultimately about something bigger than itself and powerfully resonated for it er contradicts ds3s critique of wheelspinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way disneys maligned star wars trilogy left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if new films had been made at allthe story is shockingly conservative with almost identical plot points settings characters and themes to froms back catalogue we again have wellintended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it religious fundamentalists spurned vengeful offspring agents of chaos and tarnished now literally player enforcing new world order the biggest change is bloated chain of divine command expanding ds demigods with empyrians fingers the elden beast aliens and cosmic gods but it brings few new ideas this is the reanimated corpse of concluded story that metacommented on such narrative necromancy and is immensely disappointing for it worse what little new exists is often explicit and definitive trading the intriguing mystery of dss nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories decade later for story nearly entirely resolvable in single playthroughthere is tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment its unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion conflict between irredeemable villains is far cry from the turbulent power of dss greek tragedy particularly in setting largely morally binary and with less charismatic cast standouts like rya or blaidd dont impact like solaires devastating misfortune or siegwards surprising nobility characters were the emotional core of ds but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worldsgameplay is also missed opportunity ds3s combat is great but sekiros is easily the best ever in game of its type yet were back to ds3s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities inconsistent magic and same old movesets lacking sekiros thrilling posture and counters mechanics dual wielding ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise and the camera is as bad as ever content suffers from repetition too dungeons keep cropping with the same music bosses and presentation occupying huge chunk of completionists playthrough and the nondungeon biomes feel interminable as youre incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment lore and questsquests are as obtuse as everyones saying borderline impossible to complete without guides from staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further ers first areas are exciting but fifty hours in become tedious particularly with the second halfs environments primarily being singlelevel plains with occasional repeated giant assetsthe initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity and leads to game thats harder to balance and populate with unique content particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of ds3s soul of cinder and slave knight gael bosses are just bad across the board most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges homogenising combat into wait wait wait wait single attack wait loop 150 bosses is too many for from to make each interesting fair memorable or downright enjoyableers multiplayer is also froms worst since ds1 hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible and with covenants gone so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplayfinally ers presentation is mixed its style is outstanding characters are strikingly creative and full of personality environments are dense with detail and sound effects are as satisfying as ever though the music rarely reaches ds3s heights and is often repeated but froms ambition far outpaced their technical capacity er is graphically antiquated but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years paired with disappointing framerates considerable crashing and cheating aplenty the stutter singlehandedly ruined the first third of my playthrough dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving and is bad enough to alone make this review thumbs downer wavers between being retread of old ideas and failed attempt at new ones its such missed opportunity if all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat its great the ds template alone earns er inherited praise but if youre after an emotionally and philosophically challenging story pick up ds instead
neutral,"['interesting story', ""invested in the game's lore"", ""excited for CDPR's new project"", 'hyped for the Witcher 3', ""considering The Witcher 3 as one of the best games I've ever played""]",[],null,i finished the witcher 3 for the first time this year and because of the interesting story told i got invested and started reading about the lore and some of the books despite this i wasnt as excited for cdprs new project as i wouldve been for something like the witcher 4 dont get wrong i was definitely hyped for this game cause i consider the witcher 3 as one of the best games i ever played and cyberpunk 2077 was being made by the same people 1 week before the game released i started to get hyped for it excited to dive into new world created by cdpr did it live up to the general hype the game had prior to its release if youve been on the internet at any point after this games release you know the answer to itbut since this is steam review i will only be talking about the pc versionto share some details about my first playthrough i chose the street kid lifepath and played as female v with this i come to the probably biggest disappointment the lifepaths were supposed to give you more than just unique dialogue options throughout the game they were supposed to give you unique prologue and change the way people in the world perceive and interact with you to some degree the nomad outsider was supposed to have harder time with befriending residents of night city and the other way around for the street kid in the end it sadly boils down to the unique dialogue options throughout the game and unique opening to the game that lasts total of maybe 15 minutes before all the paths end up at the same 6 month timeskip i real disappointment and wasted opportunity that i can only see getting improved with the planned dlc and not the free updates going from the disappointing lifepath system i wan na take moment to talk about the overall plot in short if someone would ask if the story was worth experiencing i would say yes i havent been this interested into game and its characters since rdr2 in 2018 for this games story is right up there with rdr2 and tlou in terms of writing and engagementthe long version and rough plot summary of the prologue to get you interested you play as v despite whatever lifepath you chose at the start mercenary and resident of night city you and your best pal jackie get job to steal relic from the biggest corporation in night city arasaka successfully pulling of this job will give you lot of eddies and street cred on top of that it is overlooked by one of the biggest fixers in all of night city dexter deshawn so you go and try to steal the relic but something goes horribly wrong you are framed with killing the emperor of arasaka as if that isnt bad enough the relic got damaged and the only way to preserve it and get anything out of this job is to slot it into one of your neuroports jackie dies on the way to dexter from fatal bullet wound and to save his own skin dexter disposes of any evidence of him having anything to do with this in other words shoots you in the head killing you this is rough summary of the prologue and if it interests you i can only recommend playing it for yourself and experiencing it for yourself it is heartbreaking story with endings either being very depressive or hopeful but not true happy ending after talking about the story lets move to the one thing standing in cyberpunks way from immersing you into its incredibly world and story the bugs they are present they are unavoidable and they will throw you out of the immersion but while there are lot of people complaining about them as i am writing this review 23122020 please keep in mind that the witcher 3 experienced similiar issues in its early life i am positive that cdpr will be able to iron out these issues and turn this game into polished product in the near future i alsowant to mention that in my 70h at the time of writing this review i have yet to crash once my game softlocked maybe once and it was resolved with reloading previous save your experience may vary since i have seen couple friends having more or less issues than myself now that i have talked about the bugs i want to talk about my favourite part of this game seperate from its story i want to point out the characters cyberpunk manages to have some of the most alive feeling characters in any game i have ever played matter if it is character that is actively part of the main plot like johnny silverhand or someone that you can completely miss like river ward they managed to make every character feel like they have their own ambitions and reasons for acting the way they are one of my favourite moments in the 70h i spend with this game was talking to convicted murderer that got bailed from death row due to turning into man of god but if agrees gets crucified for an exotic braindance most of these characters get introduced in unexpected ways that make every side quest in the game seem important i am by means someone who completes everything in game but cyberpunk managed to make finish almost every side quest i was able to find and v themselves is contestant for one of the greatest protagonists in recent memory its time to mention night city and its less impactful residents night city itself is incredibly detailed and dense there are small things to see and discover around every corner and visual story telling is strong theme the city feels like its always moving but the residents themselves are keeping this from being one of the most immersive worlds ever crafted they way npcs and cars seem to work is that they only really exist around v which is normal way to save some resources but if you drive fast on long straight road you can see cars in the distance dissapear breaking the immersion it is totally possible to turn night city into ghost town if you enter the city at high speeds this can be fixed with quicksaving and reloading your save general npc ai is barely present with them having 2 modes the first one is walking around the other one is cowering in fear running away defending themselves or calling the authorities throwing you out of the car you just stole from them nothing on top of that the police system is horrible you accidentally run someone over and the ncpd will start spawning behind you while i am of the opinion that this isnt as big of deal as people make it out to be due to the game never requiring you to mess with the police it is still sad that they werent able to provide system akin to gtas to provide fun chases and firefights outside of gigs story or side missions cdpr mentioned something about them seeing this as bug so they might fix the ai they in fact already improved it tiny bit at the time of writing this but i am not entirely convinced this is something they will be able to completely overhaulas the last thing i wan na take brief moment to talk about the rpg mechanics and the soundtrack there are total of 5 skills with sub trees in them there is lot of room for experimentation and you can definitely feel the difference between builds i dont believe you can skill in way to make the game unbeatable focusing on something like body will open up lot of doors for you but something like cool will give you more dialogue options maybe even increasing your rewards for missions making second or third playthrough feel different from the previous ones every playthrough is accompanied by great soundtrack worth mentioning here is never fade away for hitting very hard matter which ending you get i would love to write more about the mechanics and plot of the game but the steam character limiti love this game despite its flaws would recommend to friend and i am excited for the dlcthx for reading this if you did
positive,"['success', 'best game', 'impressive ai', 'unique designs']",[],null,in any industry this will always happen as an example like witcher that developed by the same company what they have shown and what they have given was different yet cuts covered only small portion that didnt have big impact on the game and it was success in general people still can defend the game as the best game since ages however for cyberpunk its not so im game developer yet i can able to understand those features cut so late perhaps at the last delay before gone gold since some of them still can be seen ingame and you dont even need to go out of bounds just go to one of the train stations youll get itive seen lots of news prior release such as impressive ai that even claims to have random npcs have daily routine in openworld depending on the daynight cycle backend with unique designs and animations you were able to chat with them ai is not for just civilians they said cops have warrant system that makes people huntpatrol on the player depending on your environmentplace the way of their involvement would even change since the producer said details law enforcement and they mentioned you can even bribe some corrupt officers to avoid this its insane that none of those claims were made into itscrew routines npcs will disappear when out of sight and if they do an action they will do it forever time doesnt have an impact on them they only have 2 to 4 dialogs to speak if you save them from something they rarely understand it they will never try to defend themselves if you shoot nearby all they do is crouching and this happens even if they ride vehicle if you try to steal their car they will simply let you do it and not even bothered by taking it back well if you crash their car by accident even in the slightest way they cease to move because you simply interrupt their defined route they will not see you while driving so expect to get run over by them lotremember what ive said about cops just imagine any game with cops and aim lower because all it does is spawning cops around your vision and all you have to do to ignore them move away since they couldnt drive anything to chase you bribes hunters patrols huge nope this is all you have they will not ask questions or try to arrest you they simply spawn to shoot matter what even in places that one able to see you commit crime one detection but youyou can be hacker with getting into peoples brains the way they have shown was unique but it just turned out they have copied and improved what watch_dogs does its fun yet its just too simple and toned down from promises you can just go into scan and hack from there need for any tools or effort but investing in the intelligence stat they attempt to make it notso overpowered by adding cooldown and magic bar to prevent you to just sit and press buttons if you watch old clipstrailers you can see what beautiful unique and immersive ui and gameplay they used to have yet also been changed into simple one insteadmelee cybernetics toned down as well mantis blades had an upgrade that allows people to crawl on the wall for example also they are not even mentioned in any quests ingame you accidentally run one of those so it appears to be there are cut missions too i kinda get why they have removed the crawl feature because it makes movement way easier on level design like this but why the hell they removed wall running mobility feels okay at its best people even abusing cybernetic called kerenzikov to cancel dodge to another dodge to overcome ityou had more options like using spiderrobot which is still ingame for only one mission and you are only can interact with it to where its going to move it is supposed to have full impact on your build not just classes lifepaths are heavily downgraded as well both in gameplay and quantity they just change how the opening sequence is instead of at least 45 hours as they promised with some dialog options sometimes changing how the missions play but not too muchits an undeniable fact that this is not an rpg they made the game linear and short than any other game they have developed so far in witcher how the game is played and how the story goes on can be changed with your actions your choices were affecting the world you live in but in cyberpunk merely nothing changes cyberpunk some rpg elements that slightly better than other openworld action games but way too far to be onethe funny thing is we comparing it with witcher which is supposed to be less deep experience according to senior level designer their interview basically summarizes witcher series had basic structure that in loop while cyberpunk is meant to have many more layers it is supposed to be not linear they also said level design will have layers but its only can be seen in some quests most places are basic outposts that dont have any verticalityi expected character customization but they made simple creation system instead you cant customize how big is your nose how your lips are shaped where are your eyes placed etc if you have played saints row less budget game you can customize those features look im not even comparing how weak it is against the souls series also you supposed to set how your character behaves whats the childhood idol basically you have the freedom to both create how your character looks and whats his background but all you left with character creation that lacks in everything that even makes you question why were not just playing with an alreadycreated onethey also got scammed us with gangs involving with the storyworld because i hardly remember most of them present i couldnt even count them since its hard to remember something that hardly makes mark on your experience some concepts showed that wildlife and animals are extinct in the universe but mechanical ones replaced them yet this is not can be seen in the game the only wildlife you can see is cats and they are predetermined it makes sense since they cant even code human ai what would be the mess if animals are more involved with the world however it just makes the game suck at immersion the trauma team is supposed to play key role but you can only see them twicethey also mentioned stuff like variety of braindance unseen weather system more romancenudityexplicit content buycustomize properties the list goes on but none of them made completely into game you only can see bds on quests weather is just like the other game and even worse than witchers you only have 4 romance 2 different characters to sleep with 4 joytoys which is hardly making bunch side note keanu reeves made great job despite what others said i liked his performance but sadly the game falls too short once you get used to having different personalities on your brain the credits will be rolledback when its first announced the game will be out whenever its ready but its not even close to it they couldnt even handle optimization and hidbanned the footage from earlyaccess review copies to lazily get away from this mess how they screw up the biggest project they had and if they could manage this game better it would be masterpiece but now its just another openworld game which most people already got bored with they kept some of their promises like the graphics and soundtrack they said that they will add more features at time but the game is beyond saving from their destruction they should have not announced release date or better when they delayed it first they should have delayed it at least around mid2021 and they should have focused on what they have first aimed for this is not the game we wanted to play but looks like what we got deserved
